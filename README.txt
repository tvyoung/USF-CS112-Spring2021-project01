NOTES
- unsure why my program needed more than one Scanner object in order to work properly
- i sought no outside assistance; was mostly just fumbling around and running the code a bazillion times
- code should have 285 lines in total
- added screenshots of all lines, just in case for some reason java file submission does not match

INSTRUCTIONS:
Welcome to the Wheel of Fortune program. The program will randomly select a movie title from 15 preset films and display a shadow of the movie name in asterisks. 

You, the player, will then "spin the wheel" to see how much you can win per letter. The possible cash values are $100, $200, $300, $400 and $500.

Afterward, the program will provide a hint by revealing the following letters if they exist in the movie title: R S T L N E

You will then have two options:
1) Guess the movie title (This earns no reward money).
2) Guess a letter in the movie that has not been revealed. For each correct guess, you will earn however much cash value that you spun earlier.

You will repeat this process until the game ends. 

The game ends by:
1) LOSE: You make 3 mistakes (guess a letter that does not exist in the movie title, or guess the movie title wrong).
2) WIN: You correctly guess all the letters in the movie title.
3) WIN: You correctly guess the entire movie title.
